I have not found this Feuille, but no doubt Brissot, in editing the essay for his journal (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Le Patriote François</i>) abridged it, and in one instance Paine is mentioned by name. Although in this essay Paine occasionally repeats sentences used elsewhere, and naturally maintains his well-known principles, the work has a peculiar interest as indicating the temper and visions of the opening revolution.—<cite>Editor.</cite> <a href="anti-monarchal-essay.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Royalty was abolished by the National Convention on the first day of its meeting, <time datetime="1792-09-21">September 21, 1792</time>, the revolutionary Calendar beginning next day. Paine was chosen by his fellow-deputies of Calais to congratulate the Convention, and did so in a brief address, dated October 27, which was loaned by <abbr>M.</abbr> Charavay to the Historical Exposition of the Revolution at Paris, 1889, where I made the subjoined translation:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><b>Citizen President:</b> In the name of the Deputies of the Department of the Pas de Calais, I have the honor of presenting to the Convention the felicitations of the General Council of the Commune of Calais on the abolition of Royalty.</p>
						<p>"Amid the joy inspired by this event, one cannot forbear some pain at the folly of our ancestors, who have placed us under the necessity of treating gravely (<i xml:lang="fr">solennellement</i>) the abolition of a phantom (<i xml:lang="fr">fantôme</i>).—<b>Thomas Paine</b>, Deputy."</p>

					<p>The reader should bear in mind that this phrase, now used vaguely, had for Paine and his political school a special significance; it implied a fundamental Declaration of individual rights, of supreme force and authority, invasion which, either by legislatures, law courts, majorities, or administrators, was to be regarded as the worst treason and despotism.—<cite>Editor.</cite> <a href="anti-monarchal-essay.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In his appeal from prison to the Convention (August 7, 1794) Paine states that he had, as a member of the Committee for framing the Constitution, prepared a Plan, which was in the hands of Barhre, also of that Committee. I have not yet succeeded in finding Paine's Constitution, but it is certain that the work of framing the Constitution of 1793 was mainly entrusted to Paine and Condorcet. Dr. John Moore, in his work on the French Revolution, describes the two at their work; and it is asserted that he "assisted in drawing up the French Declaration of Rights," by "Juvencus," author of an able "Essay on the Life and Genius of Thomas Paine," whose information came from a personal friend of Paine. ("Aphorisms, Opinions, and Reflections of Thomas Paine," etc., London, 1826. Pp. 3, 14.) A translation of the Declaration and Constitution appeared in England (Debrett, Picadilly, 1793), but with some faults. The present translation is from "Oeuvres Complhtes de Condorcet," tome xviii. The Committee reported their Constitution February 15th, and April 15th was set for its discussion, Robespierre then demanded separate discussion of the Declaration of Rights, to which he objected that it made no mention of the Supreme Being, and that its extreme principles of freedom would shield illicit traffic. Paine and Jefferson were troubled that the United States Constitution contained no Declaration of Rights, it being a fundamental principle in Paine's theory of government that such a Declaration was the main safeguard of the individual against the despotism of numbers. See supra, vol. ii., pp. 138, 139.—<cite>Editor.</cite> <a href="declaration-of-rights.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
